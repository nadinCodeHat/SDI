# SDI

I created branches to each of you. Please make sure to push your work to your respective branches.


Instructions:

1.Go to the folder where you want the project to be saved. e.g: "C:/Projects".
2.Right click and select "Git Bash Here".
3.Type "git clone https://github.com/CSWanigasooriya/SDI.git".
4.The repository willl be cloned after a while to the location where you selected.
5.Do what ever the changes you want.
6.Type "git status" to view all changes that you've done.
7.Type "git add .", this adds all the changes to the staging area.
8.Type "git commit -m "Add a meaning full commit here"". For example if you added a file: "git commit -m "Addded file Text.txt"".
9.Then finally "git push -u origin (your branch name)".Again for instance if your branch name is "chamath": "git push -u origin chamath".
